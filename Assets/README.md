**A Second Wish**

Dear team members!

We have made a lot of progress and our game is nearing a stage where it will be playable and enjoyable. 
We are set to complete the project on schedule or ahead of schedule, and with most of the features we planned for it.
Let's do our best and keep on improving the game! I hope each of you will find programming Omega Go to be very enjoyable.
