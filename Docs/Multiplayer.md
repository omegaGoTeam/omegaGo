# Multiplayer

The omegaGo app allows the player to connect to two Internet Go servers, and to play games against others players on these servers.

When we refer to "multiplayer", we mean playing on Internet servers only. Local hotseat play, while it involves two players, is not referred to as "multiplayer" in this document.
