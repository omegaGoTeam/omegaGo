Go expert analysis by Gu Li and Zhou Ruiyang

Like the first game, this is a blitz with five seconds per move. Since the first 48 moves are identical, please refer to the commentary on the first game for a thorough analysis of the opening.]RE[W+Resign]

;B[kg]LB[kf:A]C[Black 49 is the first departure from the previous game. Previously, Black extended at A, so perhaps AlphaGo was dissatisfied with the result in that game.]
;W[kh]
;B[jh]C[Now, Black chooses the double hane. If White defends as shown in the variation, the game looks promising for Black.]
(;W[md]LB[md:52][kg:49][jh:51][kh:50]C[However, White has other plans, disrupting Black’s rhythm with the sharp placement at 52.]
(;B[ld]

;W[pn]C[Bold though it may be, Black's way of playing is extremely dangerous. At this point, there is still a gap through which Black can break into the open, but the game has already grown painfully difficult. See the variation for White's anticipated continuation.]
(;B[kl]C[This peep is a probe to test White's intentions.]
;W[kk]C[White's push on the outside leaves a minor weakness, but is the most uncompromising way of playing.]
;B[kf]C[In response, Black chooses to risk it all by connecting at 71! Now the top is much stronger, but can Black live with the dragon on the right?]

(;B[kn]LB[lo:A]C[At this point, Black briefly entertains the notion that everything will be fine. However, this is merely a fantasy, and White will soon put an end to Black's hopes.

Actually, Black could also have made a ko starting with A, but the result would have been a Pyrrhic victory. See the variation.]

(;W[mm]LB[km:A]C[Black had hoped for White A, as shown in the variation, but this merciless blow lays bare the harsh reality.

Although the following fight looks complicated, the fact is that Black has lost the chance to live. White’s technique may appear suboptimal, but from AlphaGo's perspective, it is the simplest and clearest line.]

AlphaGo’s unparalleled positional judgment and outstanding ability to control the flow of the game are well known. However, some have wondered about whether it can handle life and death situations, even questioned whether such positions might drive AlphaGo berserk. This game should prove to everyone that, indeed, AlphaGo can kill.])
