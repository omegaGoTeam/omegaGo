I just want to try it, guys... just to estimate the difficulty.
If it turns out to be really really difficult, I'll stop wasting time on it.

Strategy:
1. Compile and run under Linux. [success]
2. Compile and run under Cygwin.
3. Compile and run under Microsoft Visual C++.
4. Remove Boost and other incompatible things.
5. Compile and run under UWP.
6. Create C# integration.
7. Add Oakfoam to OmegaGo.
