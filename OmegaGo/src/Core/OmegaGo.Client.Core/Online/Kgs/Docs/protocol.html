<h1>KGS JSON Protocol</h1>

<p>The JSON protocol takes the binary stream protocol of KGS and converts it into a JSON protocol based on HTTP requests. All requests
    are sent to a servlet named "access"; POST requests submit upstream (client-to-server) messages, and GET requests fetch downstream (server-to-client)
    messages. All messages have a "type" value that indicates their content and meaning. You start the process by posting a <tt><a href="upstream.html#LOGIN">LOGIN</a></tt>
    message, then immediately after the POST completes you need to post a GET request to hear the server's response. Once a GET response returns a
    <tt><a href="downstream.html#LOGIN_SUCCESS">LOGIN_SUCCESS</a></tt> message, it is safe to start posting more upstream requests.
    When a GET requests completes, post another request; you should always have a GET request active so you can get downstream messages from the server as soon as they are
    available. GET requests will time out after 1 minute and return an empty object. That's fine, this is to make sure that the requests don't time out, so just post another
    GET. As long as you get a status code 200 from your GET, all is well. Once you get a <tt><a href="downstream.html#LOGOUT">LOGOUT</a></tt> messages in your GET, then you
    are disconnected and should no longer post GET requests. A non-200 status code also indicates that you are logged out; you should always get your
    <tt><a href="downstream.html#LOGOUT">LOGOUT</a></tt> first, but if there is a networking error or some such you may get the non-200 status codes instead.</p>

<p>An extremely simple "<a href="index.html">example client</a>" that shows how to use the GET/POST protocol is provided in this webapp. It's more of a protocol test than an example
    client, but it demonstrates the sysetem.</p>

<h2>General Protocol Information</h2>

<p>A lot of the data up and down is marked as belonging to a channel. Rooms, games, challenges, private conversations, even user archives and user details are all channels.
    Every channel has an integer channelId; all messages that travel in a channel must have the channelId contained within them. Channel IDs are always positive, so they may
    range from 1 through 2<sup>31</sup>-1.</p>

<p>String constants in the protocol are a mix of <tt>ALL_CAPS</tt> and <tt>camelCase</tt>. Sorry. Constants that are from Java enums in the server code are all caps; constants that are from
    SQL database values are camel case. You must always use the exact right case for all constants.</p>

<p>The message names are fairly irregular. Originally I intended all messages names to begin with the object that they manipulate (e.g., ROOM_JOIN, GAME_LOAD), but I did not
    follow that very consistently. I also intended to have upstream and downstream messages to always have different names, with a lot of xxx_REQUEST upstream messages answered
    by xxx_SUCCESS downstream messages, but in some cases I got careless there also so there are upstream and downstream messages with the same name. I apologize for that.</p>

<h2>Warning!</h2>

<p>Has this webapp been well tested? Heck no! It's probably completely riddled with bugs. The only testing I have done so far is to use the example client to log in, join a game,
    chat a bit, etc. I will be as fast as I can in fixing any problems found and putting up a new
    version of the webapp. Please report any problems to me at <a href="mailto:wms@igoweb.org">wms@igoweb.org</a>.</p>
