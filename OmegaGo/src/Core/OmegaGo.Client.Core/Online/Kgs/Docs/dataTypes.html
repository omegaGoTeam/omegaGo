<h2><span id="user">User</span></h2>

<p>A user. Always an object. Users are sent in downstream messages, but upstream just the name is provided. It would have been cleaner to have the user flags a separate JSON fields,
but users are sent a lot and I didn't want to use so much bandwidth.</p>

<h2><span id="role">Role</span></h2>

<p>A role indicates how a player is involved in a game. A player may hold more than one role in a game. Represented as a string. It can be one of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>white</tt></li>
    <li><tt>black</tt></li>
    <li><tt>white_2</tt></li>

</ul>

<h2><span id="gameFlags">Game Flags</span></h2>

<p>Game flags are usually used as fields in a message, with a boolean value. The flags are:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>over</tt></dt>
    <dd>If set, it means that the game has been scored.</dd>
    <dt><tt>adjourned</tt></dt>
    <dd>The game cannot continue because the player whose turn it is has left.</dd>
    <dt><tt>private</tt></dt>
    <dd>Only users specified by the owner are allowed in.</dd>
    <dt><tt>subscribers</tt></dt>
    <dd>Only KGS Plus subscribers are allowed in.</dd>
    <dt><tt>event</tt></dt>
    <dd>This game is a server event, and should appear at the top of game lists.</dd>

    <dt><tt>audio</tt></dt>
    <dd>This game includes a live audio track.</dd>
    <dt><tt>paused</tt></dt>
    <dd>The game is paused. Tournament games are paused when they are first created, to give players time to join before the clocks start.</dd>
    <dt><tt>named</tt></dt>
    <dd>This game has a name (most games are named after the players involved). In some cases, instead of seeing this flag when it is set,
       a text field <tt>name</tt> will appear instead.</dd>
    <dt><tt>saved</tt></dt>
    <dd>This game has been saved to the KGS archives. Most games are saved automatically, but demonstration and review games must be saved by setting this flag.</dd>
    <dt><tt>global</tt></dt>
    <dd>This game may appear on the open or active game lists.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><span id="sgfEvent">SGF Event</span></h2>

<p>On KGS, SGF files are dynamic. A change in an SGF file is reperesented by an SGF Event object. Every SGF event has two mandatory fields: <tt>nodeId</tt> that is the ID
    of the SGF node where the event takes place, and <tt>type</tt>, that indicates what happened and what type of data is in the object.</p>

<p>Playbacks have some additional "SGF Events." These aren't really related to SGF, but the playbacks store them mixed in with SGF changes so that as the file is played back,
the SGF file will change in sync with the audio track and teacher's mouse poniter.</p>

<h2><span id="property">SGF Properties</span></h2>

<p>The SGF in KGS is not quite like "standard" SGF. Multiple marks of the same type are considered different properties, so for example <tt>TR[aa][bb][cc]</tt> on KGS
    would be three different properties, one for each location. All rules-related properties (<tt>SZ[]</tt>, <tt>TM[]</tt>, etc) are grouped together in one "rules"
    property, etc. Furthere, some properties, such as <tt>DEAD</tt>, are not part of SGF but are used internally by KGS to track the state of the game board.</p>

<p>The fields present in a node may be:</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>color</tt> for one of <tt>black</tt>, <tt>white</tt>, or <tt>empty</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>loc</tt> for a board location; it will be either the string <tt>PASS</tt> or an object with <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> values.</li>
    <li><tt>loc2</tt> for a second board location.
    <li><tt>text</tt> for text.</li>
    <li><tt>float</tt> for a floating point value.</li>
    <li><tt>int</tt> for an integer value.</li>
</ul>

<p>A proposal is an offer to start a game. It includes the rules and may include some or all of the players. If all the players needed are present in the proposal, then
it is called a "complete" proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first player in a proposal must always be the challenge owner. When manipulating a proposal, in general leave the player list in the order
it started; if you want to change the roles for each player, change the <tt>role</tt> field and not the <tt>player</tt> field. You will get strange results if you don't do this.</p>
