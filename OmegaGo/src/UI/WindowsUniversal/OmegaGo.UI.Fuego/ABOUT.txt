This class library has three main features:
- It references the Fuego Windows Runtime Component so that the native C++ library is packaged with OmegaGo.
- It has the classes FuegoBuilder and FuegoEngine which function as wrappers around the Runtime Component.
- It has a "pre-build batch script" which is a little brittle but attempts to copy appropriate boost DLL libraries to a directory where they will packaged with the resulting app.


We communicate with Fuego via Go Text Protocol (GTP).
