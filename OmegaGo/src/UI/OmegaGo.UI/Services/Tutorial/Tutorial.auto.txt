s Welcome to my class, apprentice. Are you ready to learn to play the ancient game of Go?
menu
	option It will be my honor to learn from you, honorable master.
		s And my privilege to teach you. Go is a game about surrounding territory. Your goal is to have the largest territory surrounded by stones of your color.
	option Sure. Let’s get on with it, old man.
		s Blitz games are not for beginners and you should show more respect. But we shall do as you say. Let’s begin.
next
s You will use black stones. Black goes first. Begin by placing a stone on the highlighted point, E5, please.
do E5
s Now it’s my turn. I’ll play my stone adjacent to yours. Now it’s your turn again. In Go, stones cannot be moved - you may only ever play new ones. Now put a stone at the highlighted intersection at F6, please.
white E6
do F6
s Now play at E7 to put my stone in atari.
white F5
do E7
s I’ll purposely make a bad move now. Notice how my stone at E6 is surrounded from three sides by your stones. There is only one more adjacent intersection - at D6. We call this situation “to be in atari” - it’s sort of like being in check in Chess, except less serious.
white G6
next
s If you place a stone on this intersection, D6, you will “capture” my stone, removing it from the board. Do this now. 
do D6
clear E6
s The empty space between the four black stones is now your territory and will earn you 1 point at the end of the game - unless, of course, I take it back by capturing your stones.
next
flash
s Let’s look at this situation now. The string of adjacent white stones forms a “group”. Groups can only be captured as a whole. Capture this group now.
white D5 E5 F5
black D4 E4 F4 C5 G5 E6 F6
expect D6
clear D5 E5 F5
s Good.
next
s Now you’ll try to capture some more groups.
menu
	option Yes, master.
		s Capture this new group near the corner.
	option Aww. Do I have to?
		s If you want to learn how to play Go, yes. Capture this new group near the corner.
flash
white A9 B9 A8
black A7 B8
expect C9
clear A8 A9 B9
s Good. Now this group has two adjacent empty intersections so you will need to make two moves to capture it.
white J9 J8
black J7
next
s Empty intersections adjacent to a group are called its “liberties”. This white group has 2 liberties. A group with very few liberties - such as this one - is in danger of being captured. Capture it now.
do H8
do H9
clear J8 J9
s As you can see, you need less stones to capture groups near the edges of the board.
next
s Capture this group by placing a stone in its middle.
white D6 E6 F6 F5 F4 E4 D4 D5
black D7 E7 F7 G6 G5 G4 F3 E3 D3 C4 C5 C6
expect E5
clear D6 E6 F6 F5 F4 E4 D4 D5
s Well done!
next
flash
s This group also has two liberties - one inside and one outside. Try to first place a stone inside the group.

black D7 E7 F7 G6 G5 F3 E3 D3 C4 C5 C6
shine E5
expect_failure E5
suicidal_move_message
s You can’t do it, can you? This is because suicidal moves - that is, placing stones that would immediately be captured by your opponent - are forbidden by the rules. Play on the outside liberty instead.
do G4
s At this point, your earlier move will no longer be suicidal because when you place a stone, you capture first, and only then the game checks if the opponent would capture you. Playing “suicidal moves” on the last liberty of an opponent’s group is permitted.
do E5
clear D6 E6 F6 F5 F4 E4 D4 D5
s Well done!
next
s Try to capture this group.

s What is the problem, apprentice?
menu
	option I cannot play at either liberty, master.
		s Precisely. It would be suicidal to play at any of the two intersections. Thus, this group is indestructible.
	option It’s impossible! You tricked me!
		s I am merely teaching you, young one. But you are right - this group, indeed, cannot be captured.
next
s A group that cannot be captured always looks a little like this. It has two “eyes” -  empty inside spaces where the opponent cannot play. Such a group is called “living”.
next
flash
s This group, so far, has only one eye, even though it has three liberties. Place a stone at the correct location to give the group two eyes.
black D1 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2 H1 J1
white C1 C2 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3 J3 J2
expect F1
s Well done. Your objective in a game of Go is basically to form as many and as large living groups as you can.
next
s When it’s your turn, you can do one of two things: play a stone or pass. Please pass now.
button Pass
next
s When both players pass one after another, the game ends and each player’s score is counted. Each of your stones is worth 1 points. Each empty intersection surrounded by your stones is also worth 1 point. The player with more points wins.
next
s In this game, Black wins by 10 points. However, because playing second is a disadvantage, and White always plays second, the player playing white stones usually gets 7,5 points to compensate. The exact number is different under some rules or in some tournaments.

white F9 F8 F7 F6 F5 F4 F3 F2 F1 G7 H7 H6 H5 H4 H3 J4 G3
next
s In this game, even with this handicap, Black still wins by 2.5 points.
next
s And those are the basics of playing Go. How do you feel, apprentice?
menu
	option I’m still a little confused.
		s That is only natural. The rules to Go fit on a few pages but it’s the hidden complexity of Go that allowed it to survive and blossom through the ages.
	option I’m going to become the top Go player in the world!
		s An admirable goal. If you succeed, please tell the world that it was OmegaGo who started you on your Go journey.
next
s You will need to learn more. This app’s Help will explain additional rules and some more details but the best way to start is to play games. 
next
s I suggest you play a few games on a 9x9 board against the artificial intelligence program, or maybe even against beginners on the internet.
next
s In the end, I’m afraid, there is no substitute for a human teacher. If there is a Go club in your town or city, you should know that they’ll be very happy to teach you.
next
s You have done well. Now get out there and begin your Go journey!
