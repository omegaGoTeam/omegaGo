<h2>A History of Go</h2>
<p>It is fairly certain that the game of Go originated in China more than two thousand years ago. Various legends, of course, claim that the game was invented by one emperor or another, for various purposes, and usually a long time ago. However, the first historical mention is in the writing of Confucius in the 6th century BC. The first archaeologically recovered Go board comes from the period of 206 BC to 24 AD, also from China.</p>
<p>In this period, Go was played on a 17x17 board. That is not the only change the rules underwent over the ages. Also around this period, the first four stones were placed before the game even began - on the star points - apparently in accordance with ancient Chinese astrology. Another interesting rules difference is that eyes did not count as territory - this is now called a “group tax”, as it costs a player two points for each group they form - it is thus advantageous to have a few sprawling groups rather than a number of separated ones.</p>
<p>Go was imported into Japan and Korea probably sometime after 500 AD and enjoyed popular among the aristocracy there as well. Non-Asian countries only really learned about Go in the Modern Era, and the rules were translated and published in Germany in 1880. From there, Go spread to other European countries and North America.</p>
<p>In 1930, the concept of komi compensation points was invented and the number of points awarded to White slowly rose from 2.5 in 1930 up to today’s 6.5 or 7.5, as better understanding of the first player’s advantage was developed. The last komi change came about in 2005. </p>
<p>The first Go server, the <i>Internet Go Server</i> (IGS), went online in 1992 in USA and remains widely used to this day. Additional servers sprang up afterwards, including KGS, Tygem, Dragon Go Server for correspondence games and most recently OGS, as the Internet grew in popularity.</p>
<p>In 2016, a computer program known as AlphaGo defeated the 9-dan professional player Lee Sedol in a 4-1 challenge match and thus marked the first instance where an artificial intelligence program bested human players at Go. This came as a surprise to many, as even experts thought that a computer win at Go is still at least a decade away.</p>

<h3>3. Timeline of Go in non-Asian countries</h3>
<ul><li><strong>1615</strong>: the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552-1610), who spent his last 30 years as missionary to China, writes some diaries in which explains the game of Wei-Qi. In 1615, five years after his death, another Jesuit, the Flemish Nicolas Trigault (1577-1628) translates these diaries into Latin and publishes at Augsburg the book <i>De Christiana Expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Iesu</i>, which becomes highly popular, and goes through at least 16 editions in a number of European languages in the several decades after its first publication.</li>
    <li><strong>late 17th through mid-19th century</strong>: Some westerners come into contact with Go and mention the game in writings without disclosing all rules. Of particular interest may be the German philosopher and mathematician <u>Leibniz</u> (1646 to 1716) who published an entire article about go including a picture of a go game; however, Leibniz states that he does not know all the rules.</li>
    <li><strong>1880</strong>: <u>Oscar Korschelt</u> writes an article on Go, effectively starting Go in Germany and from there Europe</li>
<li><strong>1905</strong>: <u>Edward Lasker</u> learns Go in Berlin, and later founds the New York Go Club.</li>

<li><strong>Late 20th Century, early 21st Century</strong>: Increasing numbers of westerners qualify as professionals in Japan and Korea (<u>Janice Kim</u>, <u>Catalin Taranu</u>, <u>Alexandre Dinerchtein</u>, <u>Svetlana Shikshina</u>, <u>Diana Koszegi</u>, <u>Joanne Missingham</u>)</li>

    <li><strong>April 14, 1978</strong>, UK vs. USSR International friendship match, played via telephone</li>
    <li>Sometime in the <strong>1984</strong>, Greg Hale wrote inetgo. This was the first(?) program to use the internet to play Go. Inetgo was one of the foundations for the Internet Go Server (IGS).</li>
    <li><strong>February 2, 1992</strong>, IGS starts. Written mostly by Tim Casey, it is the first server dedicated to Go, based at the University of New Mexico.</li>
    <li><strong>1994, Mar 25</strong>: First review on the <u>Go Teaching Ladder</u>: rabbit (7d) commented a game between <u>Jan van der Steen</u> (3d) and jon (1d).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Timeline of Computer Go</h3>
<ul><li><strong>1968</strong>: <u>Albert L. Zobrist</u> wrote the first ever program which played complete Go games.</li>
<li><strong>1976</strong>: David Benson publishes <u>an algorithm</u> for <u>unconditional life</u> determination.</li>
<li><strong>1984</strong>: The Acornsoft Computer Go Tournament: first ever computer go event, for programs for the <i>BBC micro</i> (6502 chip) personal computer; devised by David Johnson-Davies and <u>Charles Matthews</u>. The winning program written by Bronislaw Przybyla, was published in 1985 in the Acornsoft range. 
<li><strong>1985</strong>: Ing Cup and <u>Ing Prize</u> are started. This prestigious award drives computer Go progress for the next decade.</li>
<li><strong>1989, Mar 13</strong>: <u>GNU Go</u> 1.1 (first stable release) was posted to comp.sources.games</li>
<li><strong>1993</strong> B. Bruegmann implements Gobble, the first program based on random playouts (Monte Carlo). It was no champion, but impressive considering it had almost no Go-specific knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>1999 April</strong> GNU Go 2.0 released. This rewrite was nine stones stronger, and eventually led to a champion level opponent.</li>
<li><strong>2000</strong> The <u>Ing Prize</u> expires. The last challenge won was <u>HandTalk</u> defeating a young pro at an 11-stone handicap.</li>
<li><strong>2006</strong> Kocsis and Szepesvari develop the UCT algorithm, a form of best-first search which uses Monte Carlo evaluation (random playouts) to evaluate moves. Already in the same year, a program using it (<u>CrazyStone</u>) wins the Computer Olympiad 9x9 Go event.</li>
<li><strong>2008</strong> A programming team from INRIA led by Sylvain Gelly organize a 9x9 match between Catalin Taranu (5p) and their program <u>MoGo</u>, running on a supercomputer. <u>MoGo</u> loses the match, but wins one of the three games.</li>
<li><strong>2008</strong> At the <u>US Go Congress</u>, <u>MoGo</u> challenges an <u>8p Korean pro</u> to a 9 stone handicap exhibition game, and wins.</li>
<li><strong>2012</strong> <u>Zen</u> defeats <u>Takemiya Masaki</u> in 5- and 4-stone handicap games.</li>
<li><strong>2015, October</strong> <u>AlphaGo</u>, made by Google, challenged the reigning three-time European Go champion Fan Hui (2p) and won 5 games to 0 (equal games, no handicap). It was the first time a computer program has ever beaten a professional Go player.</li>
<li><strong>2016, March</strong> <u>AlphaGo</u> challenges Lee Sedol (9p) and wins four of the five games (equal games, no handicap). The victory against one of the strongest players of all time yielded a lot of media interest all over the world. The loss is regarded by many as the end of human domination of the game.</li>
