<h2>What’s the deal with Japanese rules?</h2>

<p>Japanese rules are a little… different from other rulesets.
<p>
    Other rulesets are, in a way, shortcuts that enable the players to score a game without playing it to the very end where it becomes disadvantageous for any player to make a move. But if a player doesn’t want to take the shortcut, that’s fine - if the players disagree about what’s the score when counting, they may just continue the game until the score becomes clear.
<p>
    Not so in Japanese rules.
<p>
    As in other rulesets, situations may occur where both players have passed but can’t agree on which groups are dead or alive.  But while under Chinese rules, the player may just “play it out”, playing it out under Japanese rules could alter the result (by a small amount of points, this is caused by the fact that playing inside your own territory costs you points under Japanese rules). So what actually happens is that the players <i>are supposed to know</i> which groups are dead or alive - based on their <i>experience</i> and <i>common sense</i>.
<p>
    There is a number of cases enumerated within Japanese rules where it’s stated whether such a group is alive or dead, but it’s never really defined what “dead” or “alive” or “two eyes” means. If you don’t know, call a judge, and the judge will decide partially based on rules, on “common sense” and on tradition.
<p>
    Most artificial intelligence programs don’t implement Japanese rules and most servers only implement territory scoring but not full Japanese rules (and there’s several variations of them).
<p>    Nonetheless, Japanese rules remain very popular and are one of the most common rulesets.
