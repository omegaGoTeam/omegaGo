<h2>Jargon</h2>
<p>This is a list of commonly used terms in Go. See also <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoTerms">Go Terms</a> for a more complete list. Some of these terms come from the Japanese language but we include them because they are very common among Go players.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Essential Terms</strong>

An atari play that reduce one&#39;s own stones&#39; liberties to one is &quot;self-atari&quot;; an atari against two groups is &quot;double atari&quot;. Stones in atari can be captured on the opponent&#39;s next turn unless they are defended. </li>
